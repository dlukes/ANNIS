# Introduction

ANNIS is an open source, browser-based search and visualization architecture for multi-layer corpora.
It can be used to search for complex graph structures of annotated nodes and edges forming a variety of linguistic structures, such as constituent or dependency syntax trees, coreference, rhetorical structure and parallel alignment edges, span annotations and associated multi-modal data (audio/video).

To learn more about how to use the ANNIS interface and the query language AQL, you can choose one of the topics at the left-side navigation.
