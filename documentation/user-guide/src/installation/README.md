# Installation

There are two editions of ANNIS, one for the local use on a standard computer (ANNIS Kickstarter) and one which is only needed when running a web-server. 
Both versions require the Installation of OpenJDK 8, e.g. via the installers provided at [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
